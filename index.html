                When I became a new mum, I learnt this the hard way. I changed
                my baby on the floor of a toilet more times than is acceptable!
                <br />
                <br />
                I created Bottle & Brew to help mothers, fathers, and those
                looking after babies and toddlers find baby-friendly cafes near
                them, so they too are not caught out with this issue. Enjoy the
                much-needed caffeine fix or yummy brunch somewhere with suitable
                baby changing facilities. ‚òï

                Additionally, I hope this site encourages more venues to install
                the facilities needed.

                <br />
                The cafes and venues plotted on the map have been submitted by a
                community of mums and dads wanting to share their favourite
                baby-friendly brunch and coffee shops near them. If you have a
                cafe you would like to reccommend, click the 'Add a Cafe' button
