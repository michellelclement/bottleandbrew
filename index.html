                Did you know that businesses in the UK do not have a legal
                obligation to offer baby changing facilities? These include
                cafes, coffee shops and restaurants.

                When I became a new mum, I learnt this the hard way. I changed
                my baby on the floor of a toilet more times than is acceptable!
                <br />
                <br />
                My biggest surprise was the cafes that target themselves to mums
                and new parents for postnatal group meetups during the day, yet
                do not have baby changing facilities themselves.
                <br />
                <br />
                I created Bottle & Brew to help mothers, fathers, and those
                looking after babies and toddlers find baby-friendly cafes near
                them, so they too are not caught out with this issue. Enjoy the
                much-needed caffeine fix or yummy brunch somewhere with suitable
                baby changing facilities.
                <br />
                <br />
                Additionally, I hope this site encourages more venues to install
                the facilities needed.
                <br />
                <br />
                The cafes and venues plotted on the map have been submitted by a
                community of mums and dads wanting to share their favourite
                baby-friendly brunch and coffee shops near them.

                Do you know of any venues with baby changing facilities that
                would be perfect for other parents? I have created a quick form
